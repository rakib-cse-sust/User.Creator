# User.Creator

Key points I covered:

Bug:
ID duplication fixed

Enhancement:
If a user's computer/app crashes, they donâ€™t lose the whole file problem checked and fixed

Refactored:
Refactored the project so that classes are loosely coupled and also testable in a chunk and also maintainable in the future.

Unit Test:
Basically, I covered the parser unit test, as mentioned in the future may some other parser introduced
Also, I wrote a using test considering mocking for FieldTypeOperations which let you know that the writing to a file working properly.
